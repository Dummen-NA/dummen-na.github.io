## Ruby and RubyGems

Ruby and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) are usually installed by default on Macs. Open your Terminal and type `which ruby` and  `which gem` to confirm that you have Ruby and Rubygems. You should get a response indicating the location of Ruby and Rubygems.

If you get responses that look like this:

```
/usr/local/bin/ruby
```
