## EOD

1. On Purchase Price list, click on "EOD Discounts" action.
2. Enter a Starting Date and Ending Date
3. Enter a Discount %

When a Sales Line is added and a Purchase Price List is found, the system will check for an EOD Discounts record where the Sales Header Order Date falls between a Starting and Ending date. If one is found, it will apply the discount as a Line Discount, unless the "EOD Disabled" checkbox is checked for that specific cost set.
